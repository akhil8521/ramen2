            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese wheat noodles served in a meat or
                fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork,
                nori, menma, and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the
                tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. Mazemen is a ramen
                dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce (such as tare).
            </p>
            <h1>Noodles</h1>
            <p>
                Most noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and kansui a type of
                alkaline mineral water,
                containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of
                phosphoric acid. Although ramen noodles and Udon noodles
                are both made with wheat, they are different kinds of noodle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kansui is the distinguishing ingredient in ramen noodles, and originated in Inner Mongolia, where
                some lakes contain large amounts of these minerals and whose
                water is said to be perfect for making these noodles. Making noodles with kansui lends them a yellowish
                hue as well as a firm texture. Eggs may also be
                substituted for kansui. Some noodles are made with neither eggs nor kansui and should only be used for
                yakisoba, as they have a weaker structure and are more prone
                to soaking up moisture and becoming extremely soft when served in soup
            </p>
            <h1>Soup</h1>
            <p>
                Ramen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined with a variety of ingredients
                such as kombu (kelp), katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes),
                niboshi (dried baby sardines), beef bones, pork bones, shiitake, and onions. Some modern ramen broths
                can also be vegetable-based. Tare is often added to broth to
                make the soup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kitakata ramen is known for its rather thick, flat, curly noodles served in a pork-and-niboshi broth.
                The area within the former city limits has the highest per-capita number of ramen establishments.
                Ramen has such prominence in the region that locally,
                the word soba usually refers to ramen, and not to actual soba which is referred to as nihon soba
                ("Japanese soba").
